## Retro RPG Online 2 Client - Open Source Version.

This is going to be an Open Source Client of Retro RPG Online 2. The major purpose of releasing it to the public is so the Graphical User  Interface can be re-designed across all platforms. It contains redundant code that is no longer used by the engine. I have also decided to release the Client so any Bugs, Exploits or Hacks can be fixed both on the Client and Server. At this stage I am NOT releasing the Server source code (Sorry but it has proprietary code).

## OBJECTIVES
1. To make the Graphical User Interface more mobile/tablet friendly by enabling bigger Icons and more comical outlays that suit the game better.
2. To fix and Bugs, Exploits or Hacks that can disrupt play on the Client and Server.

## SETUP
Simply copy the client directory into a local web Server like XAMPP and enter that address in preferably a Chrome Browser.
